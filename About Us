      Travis moved to Denver fleeing the rent hikes of San Francisco, with the goal of one day graduating Galvanize.
        With English as his only language, he's doing just fine. Working in multiple industries such as animal care and retail,
        he fully understands the need for on demand tacos.  In his off time, Travis enjoys building computers and
        playing board games such as Dark Souls and Betrayal at House on the Hill.
